## Project Overview

For this first assignment, you're going to create some boilerplate HTML. You can reuse this later in the course, but we're primarily getting our feet wet by practicing using HTML tags.

Within this single HTML document, use a variety of appropriate tags to tell your teacher and your classmates a little bit about you. Your teacher may create more specific guidelines, but pick an interesting fact and some kind of list (like your favorite foods, movies, or something else) that contains links to more information about each item.

A couple of suggestions exist below about easy-to-use online editors that don't require any installation or special software. But, trust your teacher's guidance on which tool(s) to use.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] A single HTMl document named index.html, shared from an online text editor <br />
